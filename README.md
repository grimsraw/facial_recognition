**Top facial recognition APIs that are best on the market today**

[Kairos](https://www.kairos.com/). Kairos offers a face recognition API that simplifies integrating human identity verification into your event management applications.  Their deep learning algorithms analyze faces in images you submit, returning data like attendee identification or even age and gender estimates. This can streamline the registration process and potentially enhance security. They even provide a free trial to test their functionality before committing.

[Trueface.ai](https://www.trueface.ai/). Trueface.ai offers a facial recognition API that goes beyond simple face detection.  Their API provides both 1:1 (verifying a person against a single image) and 1:N (identifying someone against a database of faces) matching.  They also boast liveness detection to combat spoofing with pictures or videos.  

[Luxand.cloud](https://luxand.cloud/). Luxand.cloud offers a face recognition API that lets you integrate facial recognition into your event management system. It can streamline attendee registration and potentially enhance security. This cloud-based API boasts high accuracy, exceeding 99% in face matching. You can use Luxand.cloud's face detection API for free, with a generous 500 API requests available monthly. This free tier allows you to experiment and see if it meets your needs before committing to a paid plan.

[Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/). Amazon Rekognition offers a powerful face recognition API that lets you add facial analysis to your event applications. It can detect faces in images, analyze facial features, and even compare faces to a reference database. This functionality can streamline attendee registration by verifying identities and potentially enhance security measures. Amazon Rekognition provides a free tier, allowing you to experiment with its capabilities before committing to a paid plan. This free tier includes a limited number of calls per month, giving you a chance to assess its effectiveness for your event management needs.

[Face++](https://www.faceplusplus.com/). Face++ offers a powerful facial recognition API that can be a valuable tool for event management. It boasts high accuracy (reportedly 99%) in recognizing faces thanks to its deep learning models trained on massive image datasets. Beyond just identification, Face++ can detect facial attributes like age, gender, and even emotions. This functionality can be used to personalize the attendee experience or gain insights into audience demographics. To get started, Face++ provides a free trial, allowing you to experiment with its features and see if it fits your event security and management needs.

[Microsoft Face API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/identity-api-reference). Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services offers a cloud-based facial recognition solution called Face API. This API boasts state-of-the-art algorithms that can detect and analyze human faces in images. Microsoft offers a free trial of Azure Cognitive Services, including Face API. This allows you to experiment with the service's capabilities and evaluate its suitability for your event management needs before committing to a paid plan.

[Google Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision). While Google Cloud Vision API offers powerful face detection features, it's important to clarify that it doesn't support facial recognition in the sense of identifying known individuals. However, it excels at  detecting multiple faces within an image, pinpointing their location with bounding boxes, and recognizing various facial attributes. This can include detecting emotions like joy or surprise, and even if people are wearing glasses or hats.  It provides a generous free tier that allows you to process up to 1,000 images monthly without charges, ideal for exploring its potential for your event management needs.

[Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/). Clarifai's face recognition API offers a powerful tool to enhance event security and streamline attendee management. It goes beyond simple face detection, enabling you to identify known individuals and gather data on attendee demographics.  This API can verify registrations at entry points, personalize experiences based on recognized attendees, and even improve safety measures.  To get started, Clarifai provides a free trial, allowing you to experiment with its features and assess its potential for your event needs.

[Skybiometry](https://skybiometry.com/). SkyBiometry offers a cloud-based face recognition API that streamlines event registration and management.  Their API boasts functionalities like detecting multiple faces at various angles, even with glasses or different expressions. This ensures accurate attendee identification. Additionally, SkyBiometry understands the importance of trying before you buy. They provide a free trial, allowing you to test the effectiveness of their face recognition technology for your specific event needs.
OpenCV. OpenCV offers a face recognition API in beta stage, allowing you to experiment with facial recognition functionalities in your projects. While not a free trial in the traditional sense, OpenCV's open-source nature makes it free to use. This API provides tools for face detection, where it identifies the presence and location of faces within an image. It then goes beyond simple detection by extracting facial feature encodings, creating unique identifiers for recognized faces. However, it's important to remember that being in beta, this API might have limitations and require more development effort compared to other solutions.
